## Choice of fonts

I don't know how to port fonts for iOS properly: I did look for guides, but they were too difficult.

The included fonts were the only fonts I found that worked without porting. [Other fonts I tested](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pGWevL6IVB8XBUhnAYazgMaWjMOsOfOZSjOoFwj6Jmk/edit?usp=sharing) all displayed in a really squished way.

## Font conversion

The CVE-2022-46689 issue - as far as I know - only lets you overwrite 16383 bytes out of every 16384 bytes: the last byte of the page can't be written.

(I could be wrong)

To work around this, I package the font using the [WOFF2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/) webfont format, which is [supported on iOS](https://twitter.com/myunderpants/status/1503745380365877252). WOFF2 uses [Brotli](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932) for compression, which lets me insert padding to skip over the last byte.

See `repackfonts/make_woff2src.sh` for details: this script:

- renames the font to .SFUI-Regular with [TTX](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) following [this answer](https://superuser.com/a/694452)
- rebuilds the font to .woff2
- runs `repackfonts/BrotliPadding.swift` to decompress the WOFF2 file and insert padding to skip past the 16384th byte
