# KFDFontOverwrite
KFDFontOverwrite is an app that allows you to overwrite fonts on iOS ported to use the [kfd](https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd) kernel read/write primitives and [xsf1re's fork](https://github.com/wh1te4ever/kfd), which further built on them.

This needs kfd offsets found in [dynamic_info.h](https://github.com/hrtowii/WDBFontOverwrite/blob/main/WDBFontOverwrite/libkfd/info/dynamic_info.h). 
If you don't see your device + iOS combination, please refer to [lrdsnow's kfd-offsets repository](https://github.com/Lrdsnow/kfd_offsets), add them to dynamic_info, and change the 4 + 0x8 to 0x10. then build with xcode. 

If you don't have xcode, please wait or open a PR with your dynamic_info.h. I will collate them together and push IPAs everyday.

I'm waiting for a unfiied dynamic_info.h file to come out with every device/iOS combination (it will be monstrously long)

## How do I use it?
1. open the app, wait 30 seconds to kopen 
2. apply fonts
3. kclose (it will automatically respring)

If you're using custom fonts, you can import them first, then follow the 3 steps.

## How does overwriting to a file work?
Answer: Following [opa334's](https://twitter.com/opa334dev/status/1684995963960643584) [instructions](https://twitter.com/opa334dev/status/1684993935213539328) on Twitter, I managed to create a function that overwrites the contents of one file to another without requiring vnode offsets.

Source for this code is in my [kfd fork](https://github.com/hrtowii/kfd/commit/751f85cb991041df1b264713bbb7cfb187499f45), this project, and in [xsf1re's github repository](https://github.com/wh1te4ever/kfd/blob/main/kfd/fun/thanks_opa334dev_htrowii.m)

# Original README.md
Proof-of-concept app to overwrite fonts on iOS using [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213530).

Works on iOS 16.1.2 and below (tested on iOS 16.1) on unjailbroken devices.

IPA available in the [Releases](https://github.com/ginsudev/WDBFontOverwrite/releases) section.

Fonts included:

- DejaVu Sans Condensed
- DejaVu Serif
- DejaVu Sans Mono
- Go Regular
- Go Mono
- Fira Sans
- Segoe UI
- Comic Sans MS

## Where to find ported fonts

- [@PoomSmart](https://github.com/PoomSmart/EmojiFonts/releases)

## Known issues

 - The built-in fonts are not properly ported (I don't know how to port fonts). For best results, use a custom font.
   - with the built-in fonts:
   - Only regular text uses the changed font: thin/medium/bold text falls back to Helvetica instead.
   - If the font doesn't show up at all, [disable "Bold Text"](https://twitter.com/m7mdabu7assan/status/1607609484901289985) in accessibility settings.
 - File pickers in apps will fail to open with the error "Something went wrong while displaying documents." 
   - This happens if you replace the emoji font, or install fonts with [multiple weights](https://twitter.com/Gu3hi/status/1607986473198026752)
   - Try the experimental .ttc fix by using "Import custom <font> with fix for .ttc"
 - iOS 14.x devices which are jailbroken / were jailbroken before will not be able to revert to the original font.
   - Workaround: do not use this app if you're on iOS 14.x and have previously jailbroken. Instead, just jailbreak and replace fonts normally.

## Font conversion

The CVE-2022-46689 issue - as far as I know - only lets you overwrite 16383 bytes out of every 16384 bytes: the last byte of the page can't be written.

(I could be wrong)

To work around this, I package the font using the [WOFF2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/) webfont format, which is [supported on iOS](https://twitter.com/myunderpants/status/1503745380365877252). WOFF2 uses [Brotli](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932) for compression, which lets me insert padding to skip over the last byte.

See `repackfonts/make_woff2src.sh` for details: this script:

- renames the font to .SFUI-Regular with [TTX](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) following [this answer](https://superuser.com/a/694452)
- rebuilds the font to .woff2
- runs `repackfonts/BrotliPadding.swift` to decompress the WOFF2 file and insert padding to skip past the 16384th byte
